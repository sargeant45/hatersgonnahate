title: Attack on Titan is Terrible
---

My friends are into anime. They always talk about how "gritty" and "deep" animes like *Sword Art Online* and *Attack on Titan* are, and how "well written" their content is. A couple days ago, I decided to try to experience the "masterpiece" that is "ALL ANIME!" so I tried out Attack on Titan. It confirmed whatever criticisms I have and have had for a long time about anime. List time!

## 1. Character Development is Almost Nonexistent
Character development in Attack on Titan is minimal, and there are too many "unimportant" characters in the storyline with one-sentence personalities. Even the main character, Eren, can be explained in like four short fucking sentences:

> Eren, from the first few episodes, has been known as an angry young man. That's his entire personality. He wants revenge on the Titans. 20+ episodes later, he's still a one-dimensional character who's all about revenge.

That was [Anime Bowl](http://www.animebowl.com/2014/10/why-attack-on-titan-sucks.html), a veteran of anime, explaining Eren. Great job, Japan!

## 2. Exposition Bullshit
For the entire show, it feels like every few lines there is a line that is completely for the purpose of exposition. It's all *exposition*, ***exposition***, ***EXPOSITION***. Halfway through an episode there is a [title card](http://imgur.com/a/WPyqQ) with exposition, then another title card after that title card with more writer horseshit exposition. I mean, at least use the show to do the explaining. If you have to shove a fucking title card in somebody's face like "HERE'S YOUR INFORMATION FUCKING READ IT BECAUSE WE CAN'T FIT IT INTO OUR BADLY PACED EPISODES!", you are doing something wrong.

## 3. Exposition Content is Bullshit
Number 3, the exposition itself is random garbage! Take for instance the title card in episode one, or should I show you a "gritty" title card with the name of the episode on it.

This title card tells us that the walls are, well, a fucking GIGANTIC distance from each other, and are like fucking THOUSANDS of kilometres long. Are you fucking kidding me? Later, Eren or someone says "but those walls are *50 meters* tall!" Get your fucking facts straight. If you can make a wall that is FUCKING LONGER THAN THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA while GIGANTIC MUSCLE SKELETONS THAT WANT TO EAT YOU are roaming the Earth, at least make it bigger than the GIGANTIC FUCKING MONSTERS you are making the wall to stop in the FIRST PLACE! AGBHTIGB!!!11!!

Goodbye for now.
